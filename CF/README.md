# AWS CloudFormation Templates

This folder contains **samples** of CloudFormation Templates to build Big-IP Lab environment, where the latest one of the templates is described in greater length in [Big-IP Lab Environment Repository](https://github.com/gjwdyk/BigIP-Lab).
So for one who is looking for the latest version, the main/root folder of this repository is the right place: [Big-IP Lab Environment Repository](https://github.com/gjwdyk/BigIP-Lab).

This folder contains 2 files for each sample CloudFormation Template: one with ending `.json` and the other with ending `_Original.json`.
The file ending with `_Original.json` is where the codes are actually developed, where the formatting of the code writing is not always consistent.
The file ending with `.json` is where the final code were fed into some ironing, and the output formatting of the code is neat and consistent, and for some people easier to read.
